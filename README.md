[Osmosmjerka](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmosmjerka) (*Croatian word for eight-direction word search puzzle*) is a feature-rich web-based [word search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search) game with language learning capabilities.
It uses phrases from the internal database, which are divided into separate categories, so each puzzle has a certain theme.
Each phrase includes translation into another language, making it an excellent tool for [flashcard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard)-style language training.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-language Interface**: Complete i18n support with English, Croatian, and Polish translations, easily extendible
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between themes for comfortable viewing
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Game State Persistence**: Automatic progress saving and restoration
- **Administrative Tools**: Comprehensive database management with import/export and batch operations
- **Touch & Mouse Support**: Seamless interaction across all devices
- **User Management System**: Role-based access control with root admin capabilities
- **Language Set Management**: Organize phrases into separate language collections
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk editing with category management and multi-select actions
- **Optimized Performance**: Smart API loading and reduced server requests for better user experience

## How it works
Osmosmjerka consists of three layers - a frontend app in [React](https://react.dev/), a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)-based HTTP server and a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
The web app communicates with the server, which pulls data from the database and returns it via HTTP requests to the frontend.
The database so far is expected to have a single table called `phrases`, which consists of three self-explaining columns `categories`, `phrase` and `translation`.
You need to provide your own sets of phrases, either by inserting them directly to the database or use the *Upload Phrases* functionality on the admin page. The supported file formats are `.txt` and `.csv`, and the expected single-line format is `<categories>;<phrase>;<translation>`.
The phrases should have at least 3 characters, since less is going to make the hell of a game to find in a grid, however, the API will filter them out automatically.

## The game

![Game](docs/assets/osmosmjerka-game.gif)

The player needs to find phrases shown on the phrase list in the displayed grid. The phrases can be found vertically, horizontally, diagonally and with the reversed order of letters.
The puzzle is generated based on the chosen theme and its size (currently there are four levels of difficulty).

The word search grid generation uses an intelligent algorithm that creates challenging puzzles by maximizing phrase intersections and maintaining directional diversity. For detailed information about the grid generation algorithm, including technical specifications, performance characteristics, and implementation details, see [ALGORITHM.md](ALGORITHM.md).

![New round](docs/assets/osmosmjerka-new-round.png)

Once the phrase is found, there's a neat confetti effect displayed and the translation of the phrase appears on the phrase list.
When all phrases are discovered, the game ends and allows to load a new puzzle.

## Game Features

![Game features](docs/assets/osmosmjerka-main-game-features.gif)

### Progressive Hints System
Osmosmjerka includes an advanced progressive hints system that provides graduated assistance to help players solve challenging puzzles. This feature can be controlled both globally by administrators and individually by each user.

**How Progressive Hints Work:**
- **Multi-level Assistance**: The hint system provides increasingly specific help through multiple levels
- **First Letter Hints**: Initial hints reveal the first letter of hidden phrases in the grid
- **Advanced Hints**: Subsequent hint levels may reveal additional letters or provide more specific guidance
- **Limited Usage**: Players receive a set number of hints per game to maintain challenge balance
- **Visual Feedback**: Hints are highlighted directly in the grid with clear visual indicators

**Configuration Options:**
- **Global Control**: Root administrators can enable or disable progressive hints system-wide through the System Settings panel
- **User Preferences**: Individual users can override the global setting in their User Profile to enable/disable hints for their account specifically
- **Flexible Override**: Users can choose to use the global setting, explicitly enable hints, or explicitly disable hints regardless of the global configuration

### Scoring System
The scoring system adds a competitive element to the word search experience, tracking player performance and providing achievement metrics.

![Game statistics page](docs/assets/osmosmjerka-stats-dashboard.gif)

**How Scoring Works:**
- **Performance Tracking**: The system monitors various gameplay metrics including completion time, hint usage, and accuracy
- **Achievement Recognition**: Players earn scores based on their efficiency and skill in solving puzzles
- **Progress Monitoring**: Long-term statistics help players track their improvement over time
- **Comparative Analysis**: Scoring enables comparison between different gameplay sessions and difficulty levels

**Scoring Configuration:**
- **Global Toggle**: Root administrators can enable or disable the scoring system globally through the System Settings
- **User Override**: Similar to progressive hints, users can override the global scoring setting in their personal profile
- **Flexible Control**: The scoring system can be customized per user while maintaining system-wide defaults

**Statistics and Analytics:**
- **Game Completion Rates**: Track how many games are started versus completed
- **Time Performance**: Monitor average completion times across different difficulty levels
- **Hint Usage Patterns**: Analyze how frequently hints are used and at what stages
- **Category Performance**: See which phrase categories are most challenging for users

## Multi-language Support

Osmosmjerka features complete internationalization (i18n) support with currently three language options: English, Polish and Croatian.
Adding the support for new language is very simple - create a new language JSON file in `frontend/src/locales`, translate all entries based on other language files, and use it in [`frontend/src/i18n.js](frontend/src/i18n.js) file.

All of the user facing texts are translated, including error messages and admin interface labels.

## Responsive Design

Osmosmjerka is built with responsive design principles to provide an optimal experience across all device types and screen sizes.
The responsive design ensures that whether you're playing on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer, you'll have an engaging and user-friendly experience tailored to your device.
On mobile screens, some interface elements are reduced to minimum, to keep as much space for the playing area as possible.

## The admin page

The admin page can be accessed via the `/admin` endpoint, which displays a login screen. The system supports multiple user roles with different access levels and provides comprehensive database management capabilities.

For detailed information about all admin panel features and capabilities, see the [Admin Panel Features](#admin-panel-features) section below.

### User Roles and Authentication
- **Root Administrator**: Created automatically on first startup, has full system access including user management
- **Administrative Users**: Can manage word database but cannot create/delete other users
- **Regular Users**: Game access only (future feature)

The login credentials for the root admin (username and password hash) must be provided via `.env` file (check the `.env.example` file) or the respective env variables before the application is started. Additional users can be created through the user management interface.

### How to generate admin's password hash
Use this one-liner to convert your password into a hash, which then you can use to log into admin's page:
```bash
python3 -c "import bcrypt; import getpass; pwd=getpass.getpass('Password: ').encode(); print(bcrypt.hashpw(pwd, bcrypt.gensalt()).decode())"
```

## Admin Panel Features

The System Settings panel provides an intuitive interface for managing these configurations, with clear descriptions of each setting's impact and current status indicators.

## Language Sets

![Language set management page](docs/assets/osmosmjerka-language-set-mgmt.gif)

Language Sets are an organizational feature that allows you to manage separate collections of phrases for different languages, themes, or learning objectives. This feature transforms Osmosmjerka from a simple word search game into a comprehensive language learning platform.

### What are Language Sets?

A Language Set is a distinct collection of phrases that can be managed independently from other collections. Each Language Set contains its own phrases, categories, and configuration settings. Think of it as creating separate "databases" within your Osmosmjerka instance - for example, you might have one Language Set for Croatian-English learning, another for Spanish-French, and a third for specialized vocabulary like medical terms.

### The Core Idea

The Language Set concept addresses several key needs:

**Multi-language Support**: Organize phrases by language pairs (e.g., Croatian-English, Polish-German, Spanish-Italian) without mixing vocabularies from different language combinations.

**Thematic Organization**: Create focused collections for specific learning goals - business vocabulary, travel phrases, academic terms, or children's vocabulary.

**User Customization**: Different users can work with different Language Sets based on their learning needs, while administrators can maintain separate content collections.

**Content Isolation**: Keep experimental or specialized content separate from your main phrase collections, allowing for safe testing and development.

### Impact on the Game

Language Sets fundamentally enhance the gaming experience by providing:

**Targeted Learning**: Players can focus on specific vocabulary sets relevant to their current learning objectives, making study sessions more efficient and goal-oriented.

**Difficulty Scaling**: Different Language Sets can contain phrases of varying complexity, allowing learners to progress from beginner to advanced levels within the same application.

**Context-Aware Puzzles**: By selecting appropriate Language Sets, players ensure that puzzle themes remain consistent and educationally coherent.

**Personalized Experience**: Users can ignore categories they're not interested in within each Language Set, creating a truly personalized learning environment.

### Creating and Managing Language Sets

#### Creating a New Language Set

1. **Access Language Sets Management**: Navigate to the admin panel and click on "Language Sets Management"
2. **Create New Set**: Use the "Create New Language Set" function to establish a new collection
3. **Configure Basic Settings**: Set the display name, description, and initial configuration for your new Language Set
4. **Define Categories**: Establish the category structure that will be used within this Language Set

#### Loading Records into a Language Set

1. **File Preparation**: Prepare your phrase files in the supported format: `<phrase>;<translation>;<categories>`
2. **Select Target Language Set**: In the admin panel, ensure you have the correct Language Set selected before importing
3. **Upload Process**: Use the "Upload Phrases" functionality to import your data into the selected Language Set
4. **Validation**: The system automatically validates entries, filters duplicates, and ensures data integrity

#### Setting Default Ignored Categories

1. **Access Language Set Configuration**: Open the Language Sets Management interface
2. **Select Language Set**: Choose the Language Set you want to configure
3. **Category Management**: Access the category configuration for the selected set
4. **Define Ignored Categories**: Set which categories should be ignored by default for new users of this Language Set
5. **Save Configuration**: Apply the settings to make them effective for future users

#### Making a Language Set Default

1. **Language Set Selection**: In the Language Sets Management interface, locate your desired Language Set
2. **Default Configuration**: Use the "Set as Default" option to make this Language Set the default choice for new users
3. **User Impact**: New users will automatically start with this Language Set, while existing users can switch manually
4. **System Behavior**: The default Language Set determines which phrases are used when no specific Language Set is selected

### Advanced Language Set Features

**Bulk Operations**: Move phrases between Language Sets using batch operations for efficient content organization.

**Export/Import**: Export entire Language Sets for backup or sharing, and import complete Language Set configurations.

**Category Synchronization**: Maintain consistent category structures across multiple Language Sets while allowing for set-specific customizations.

**User Assignment**: Configure which users have access to specific Language Sets for controlled content distribution.

**Performance Optimization**: Language Sets are loaded efficiently with smart caching and minimal API requests, ensuring responsive user experience even with large vocabulary collections.

The Language Set feature transforms Osmosmjerka into a flexible, scalable platform that can accommodate diverse learning needs while maintaining the engaging word search gameplay that makes vocabulary acquisition enjoyable and effective.

## How to run
1. Pull the code and enter the main directory.
2. Create the `.env` file from the template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Set the variables in the `.env` file. 
The `ADMIN_` variables are used as the credentials to the administrator's page (the hash must be made with [bcrypt](https://github.com/pyca/bcrypt) like this: `bcrypt.hashpw(b"YOUR_PASSWORD", bcrypt.gensalt())` and the secret is any raw string of your choice). The ignored categories allows you to filter out entries of certain categories from your database you don't want to be used in the game.
4. Deploy your PostgreSQL in K8s using the [example](/helpers/k8s-postgres.yaml) YAML or use your own existing instance. Create the database and user account, then fill the `POSTGRES_` variables in the `.env` file. The table will be created upon the first connection.
5. Build the Docker image using:
```bash
docker build -t osmosmjerka --build-arg VERSION=v1.0.0 .
```
6. Start the app, exposing the `8085` port:
```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 8085:8085 --name osmosmjerka osmosmjerka
```
7. Access the app in your browser at `http://<the host ip>:8085`.

## Example phrases database
You might use my Croatian-Polish phrase database as an example placed in the `example` folder. Import it in the admin dashboard using "Upload phrases" button.

## HTTPS
The API server ([`uvicorn`](https://www.uvicorn.org/)) supports SSL. If you're not using Nginx or other tech, you might continue using `uvicorn` with HTTPS, making use of self-signed certificate or issued by [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). 
Store them in the `backend` directory and update your command-line:
```bash
uvicorn your_module:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 443 --ssl-keyfile=<your private key.pem> --ssl-certfile=<your cert chain file.pem>
```
or the `Dockerfile` entrypoint:
```bash
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "443", "--ssl-keyfile=<your private key.pem>", "--ssl-certfile=<your cert chain file.pem>"]
```

Now Osmosmjerka is available on `https://<the host ip>`.

### How to generate a self-signed certificate
Use the `openssl` command to create both key and certificate chain files:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
As this is self-signed, the browser will show you dreadful warnings when accessing the app.

## Planned features and fixes
- Integration with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- API optimization and potential load balancing
